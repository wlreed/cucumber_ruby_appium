This repository is based on the code from here:  https://github.com/wlreed/ruby_appium.

Setup instructions and an overall idea of the project can be found there.  
The difference with this repo is that it is more object oriented and features POM (Page Object Model),
as well as Design Patterns (Singleton, Factory, Decorator).

Although there are few tests, this repo is an example of the infrastructure and framework, rather than actual tests.
